MapGenie is an assistant for [IBM Sterling Transformation Extender](https://www.ibm.com/en-en/products/transformation-extender). If you have implemented ITX data transformation maps with ITX Design Studio, you probably concluded that it **sucks ass**. This is an attempt on improving the developer experience in ITX, by automatically doing stuff that you may be doing by hand right now.
